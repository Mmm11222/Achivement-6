# Instacart_Python
Instacart Grocery Basket in an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.

# Project Goal
The  yacht and boat sales website  marketing team is
preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners. The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get more views of their boat, as well as stay on top of market trends.
They would like me to take a look at the recent data and get some insights.

# Data
This data set is one of the proposed ones in the Achievement 6 Brief, and it was sourced from Kaggle. This data set is open source and recent (2021), comprised of one csv file, (size 1.15 MB, 10 columns and 9883 rows)  and  it expected to be updated annually.
